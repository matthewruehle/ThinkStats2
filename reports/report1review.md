Primary result based on abstract: there is a positive correlation between NBA player salaries and "PER" (a relevant NBA statistic on performance).


Motivating question: determining whether higher-paid players in the NBA merit their comparatively-higher compensation.

Dataset(s), agencies: Salary database from hoopshype.com; PER stats from ESPN (PER is a NBA stat).

Analyses: salary distributions are long-tailed; PER is also long-tailed, but to a significantly lower degree. There is a positive correlation between the variables - .5 correlation, .4 Spearman correlation.

The analysis answers the motivating question, though the interpretation seems a bit sparse: the two datasets seem like they could produce more by way of observations than just the existence of a small correlation. I would personally be interested in exploration of player salaries and performances as their own entities - that is to say, more observation beyond just noting that they're long-tailed; I feel like there's likely some interesting observations that could be drawn from further examination.

The report is clear: although at times it seems sparse, it's very easy to follow and understand. The interpretation iss not particularly engaging, unfortunately.

The presentation is professional.
