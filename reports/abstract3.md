## Food Trinities and Recipe Completion

Matt Ruehle

We can tell where a food is from - at least, culturally - from just a few bites. There are palettes of ingredients and spices which are strongly associated with each other - giving cajun cooking its kick, and french cuisine its "je ne sais quoi." But, what exactly these palettes and pairings are varies - ask ten different chefs, and you'll get six different answers. We look for a statistical way to identify "trinities" like "onion, carrot, celery" or "garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce," in the process both identifying several trends not typically reflected in culinary literature and creating a tool which extends recipes based on their already-known ingredients, in a manner akin to a food version of a cell phone's autocomplete.
